# DesignPatternDemos	

<p>Design Pattern is a method of modeling computer software development solutions, it is used to organize the classes used in the source codes in order to allow the re-use of the developed solutions and the simplicity of the modifications of the needs during the phases of developments.
In this follows, a scintetic presentation for the majority of patterns used in the development of computer software.</p>
<p><b>Behavior pattern </b>:Behavior patterns are usually concerned for the communication between objects.</p>   
<p>							
						  <ul class="list-unstyled">
								<li><span class="fa fa-caret-right"></span>State Pattern: It allows to create objects that represent several states, the object changes its state according to the called methods</li>
								<li><span class="fa fa-caret-right"></span>Pattern command: The query is encapsulated in an object as a command and passed to an object sender, the emitter identifies the appropriate object for the command and passes it this command for execution.</li>
								<li> <span class="fa fa-caret-right"></span>Strategy Pattern: It defines and encapsulates a family of alghoprtithms.The program selects one of these alghorithms based on the class Context.
It is a pattern that changes during the run time. It is used for example in the case of Swtich Case where the switches are replaced by class processing.</li>
								<li> <span class="fa fa-caret-right"></span>Observe Pattern :It allows a part of the system to know when an event has taken place, if an object changes state the other dependent objects will be automatically notified.</li>
							  </ul>	
</p>

<p><b>Creation pattern </b>:The creation pattern concerns the creation of the objects, they hide the informations of the creation of the objects.</p>

<p>							
						  <ul class="list-unstyled">
								<li> <span class="fa fa-caret-right"></span>Factory Pattern: The factory pattern is one of the most used Design Patterns, it allows the creation of an object without the display of the creation logic to the client based on a common interface.</li>
								<li> <span class="fa fa-caret-right"></span>Abstruct Factory Pattern:It allows to provide an interface to create objects of the same family without specifying their concrete classes. the objects are grouped together as a family, the system must use the objects of a family or other. Typically used in the creation of libraries to encapsulate program methods through the provision of interfaces to client programs.</li>

								<li><span class="fa fa-caret-right"></span>Builder Editor: It is used to create a complex object using simple objects and based on the step-by-step approach.</li>

								<li> <span class="fa fa-caret-right"></span>Singleton Pattern: This pattern ensures that there is a class instance that will be accessible through a global access point.</li>
							  </ul>
