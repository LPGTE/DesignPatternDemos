# DesignPatternDemos	

<p>Design Pattern is a method of modeling computer software development solutions, it is used to organize the classes used in the source codes in order to allow the re-use of the developed solutions and the simplicity of the modifications of the needs during the phases of developments.
In this follows, a scintetic presentation for the majority of patterns used in the development of computer software.</p>

<p>							
						  <ul class="list-unstyled">
								<li><span class="fa fa-caret-right"></span>State Pattern: It allows to create objects that represent several states, the object changes its state according to the called methods</li>
								<li><span class="fa fa-caret-right"></span>Pattern command: The query is encapsulated in an object as a command and passed to an object sender, the emitter identifies the appropriate object for the command and passes it this command for execution.</li>
								<li> <span class="fa fa-caret-right"></span>Strategy Pattern: It defines and encapsulates a family of alghoprtithms.The program selects one of these alghorithms based on the class Context.
It is a pattern that changes during the run time. It is used for example in the case of Swtich Case where the switches are replaced by class processing.</li>
								<li> <span class="fa fa-caret-right"></span>Observe Pattern :It allows a part of the system to know when an event has taken place, if an object changes state the other dependent objects will be automatically notified.</li>
